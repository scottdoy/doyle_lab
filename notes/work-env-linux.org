* Platforms - Linux Notes
** General Linux
*** [[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/whats-this-linux-thing-and-why-should-i-try-it/][Quick introduction to Linux and why you should use it.]]
- Linux is an operating system, like Windows and MacOS
- Linux comes in flavors called "distros" or distributions with bundles of software that are all configured to work well together
- Linux is a free operating system (Windows 10 is around $150)
- It is highly configurable -- you (or a programmer) can make it do almost anything you want
- It has a lot of security features (it is designed for a multi-user environment)
- It's not too difficult to use (although it can quickly get complex the more you play with it)
- As you get better with computers (programming and scripting and automating things) you'll find Linux allows you to do much more than Windows
- You can install it by finding a distro you like and burning an ISO file onto a CD, or creating a USB installer
- If you are stuck on what distro to try, use Ubuntu first

You probably won't need these if you're using a modern distro, they will do all
the partitioning for you. Still, if you're the kind of person who likes to know
what all the folders in your =C:\= drive are for:

but a good place to look after mastering the basics.

a specific command.
