* Platforms - Linux Notes
** General Linux
*** [[http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/whats-this-linux-thing-and-why-should-i-try-it/][Quick introduction to Linux and why you should use it.]]
- Linux is an operating system, like Windows and MacOS
- Linux comes in flavors called "distros" or distributions with bundles of software that are
all configured to work well together
- Linux is a free operating system (Windows 10 is around $150)
- It is highly configurable -- you (or a programmer) can make it do almost
anything you want
- It has a lot of security features (it is designed for a multi-user
environment)
- It's not too difficult to use (although it can quickly get complex the more
you play with it)
- As you get better with computers (programming and scripting and automating
things) you'll find Linux allows you to do much more than Windows
- You can install it by finding a distro you like and burning an ISO file onto a
CD, or creating a USB installer
- If you are stuck on what distro to try, use Ubuntu first

You probably won't need these if you're using a modern distro, they will do all
the partitioning for you. Still, if you're the kind of person who likes to know
what all the folders in your `C:` drive are for:

Practice a unix-like system in your browser to get the hang of typing in a
terminal / command line

Collection of Unix/Free-BSD/Linux commands. This is pretty advanced and dense,
but a good place to look after mastering the basics.

Another list of commands, listed alphabetically. Again, useful for searching for
a specific command.
