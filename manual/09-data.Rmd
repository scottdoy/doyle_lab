## Data Organization

[data organization: organizing data in
  spreadsheets](https://kbroman.org/dataorg/)

### Be consistent

- Use consistent codes for categorical variables
- Use a single fixed code for any missing values
    - Don't use a numeric value
    - Distinguish between actually missing values and "missed" values
    - Don't leave a note in place of the value (keep a separate "notes" column)
    - R uses "NA", Matlab uses "NaN"
- Use consistent variable names for the same objects
- Use consistent subject IDs
- Use a common data layout in multiple files
- Use consistent file names
    - Have a system for file names
- Use a common format for all dates, preferably YYYY-MM-DD
- Use consistent phrases in your notes for similar topics
- Be careful with whitespace -- depends on software, but Excel differentiates
  between a blank cell and a cell with ' '

### Write dates like YYY-MM-DD

- Excel tries to mess with cells that look like dates, so force them to be
  formatted as "Text"

### No empty cells

- Distinguish between unintentionally blank cells and missing values by using a
  code for missing values -- thus no cell should be intentionally left blank
- Don't have column names that span cells, or leave some cells blank to make it
  look nicer -- messes with the data analysis
- Keep data in a "tidy" format, even though this sometimes makes the tables
  longer and with duplicated data

### Put just one thing in a cell

- Identify individual variables and separate them into columns
- Use column names to indicate units, or better yet, maintain a data dictionary
- Use a separate column with notes if you must
- Don't merge cells

### Make it a rectangle

- Each row is a subject, each column is a variable, with the first row
  containing variable names
- If this would lead to a lot of repetition, separate the data into multiple
  tables (linked with IDs)

### Create a data dictionary

- A file that explains what all of the variables are
- Laid out in rectangular form
- Table contains:
    - Exact variable name
    - Version of the variable name used in data visualizations
    - Longer explanation of what the variable means
    - Measurement units
    - Expected min and max values (possibly)
- Include this with a Readme file including an overview of the project and data

### No calculations in the raw data files

- Primary data should contain *just the data*: no calculations, no graphs
- DON'T TOUCH YOUR DATA
- Make copies of the file and do calculations in that, if you must, for
  exploration

### Don't use font color or highlighting as data

- Instead of highlights, create another column with text labels

### Choose good names for things

- Don't use spaces, use underscores (or hyphens, but be consistent)
- Don't use whitespace before or after a variable name, and don't use special
  characters, and don't start variable names with an underscore or a number
- Short but meaningful names (but not too short)
- Preference: don't use capitalization
- NEVER write a filename with the word "final" in the name

### Make backups

- The rule of three: At least two backups, one of which is off-site
- If it's not backed up, it might as well not exist
- Backups also mean that other people can access your data / code / papers /
  thesis if they need to
- Use a formal version control system like git to keep track of code and paper
  writing; use Box for housing data
- Write-protect data that you aren't actively working on

### Use data validation to avoid errors

- Select a column in Excel
- In the menu bar, choose Data -> Validation
- Choose appropriate validation criteria
- This will ensure that data entered manually must conform to some kind of range

### Save the data in a plain text format

- In general, save data as comma-delimited files
- If you have data entries that do not convert over to CSV, that's an indication
  your data needs to be reworked to get it in the right format

### Other things to avoid

- Ensure that data is not converted to scientific notation "1e6" or to hex, etc.
- Split window is weird, but "Freeze Panes" is good
- Make sure that if a value is zero, it's entered as zero. If the value is
  missing, enter in the missing code, e.g. "NA". If the cell is blank, that
  counts as a data entry error
